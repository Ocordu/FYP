        Born to be a successful procrastinator, technology lover and an
        absolute stereotype breaker (hence taking Computer Science as a
        girl); in love with playing volleyball, videogames and reading detective
        novels; if career is not at Microsoft, secret dream is to work in a forensic, but granted I
        manage to pass this foundation year.
