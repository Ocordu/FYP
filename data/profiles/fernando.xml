		Student (or is it sleep deprived procrastinator?). Also writer, musician and retired Counter-Strike player/filmmaker.
		Avid cultural consumer and concertgoer. Devoted reader and film watcher, obsessive collector of beautiful photographs and music addict. Also TV series follower (or better, binge watcher) and one who knocks.
		Proud Android owner (I bet you thought I was a hipster), rooted and ROM'd.
		Devoted fan of my football club and of my country's food, in good Portuguese tradition. Thankfully, the said love for food is bundled with the love for hard workouts.
		Thinker, adherent of some sort of existentialism.
		"We don't see things as they are; we see them as we are." - Ana√Øs Nin
