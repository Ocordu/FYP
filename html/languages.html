                    <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>, also known as <b>HTML</b>, is a markup language used to create applications and
                    documents online that can be accessed by anyone.
                    The usage of HTML for the creation of webpages is essential, because it helps formatting pieces of
                    text and pictures in such way that the internet browser displays them the way they are supposed to
                    look. HTML alone cannot provide a basic structure of a webpage, hence why it is mostly being used
                    with a styling auxiliary language called Cascading Style Sheets, also known as CSS <sup>1</sup>. As
                    a markup language, HTML itself provides explanations of the content within the code itself through
                    the use of tags. For instance, a p tag is used to begin a new paragraph, a title tag defines the
                    title of the webpage, and so on. It is essential to know the basic tags used in HTML coding in order
                    to master the structure of a website <sup>2</sup>. HTML tags are contained between the “less than”
                    and “greater than” signs, which mark the beginning and ending of a tag. Everything that is written
                    within these signs affect what is being shown on the webpage. These are the attributes of the
                    element in cause <sup>3</sup>. <br /><br />
                </ul>

                    <u2>
                        <p>As the audience and demand of the Internet grow, HTML is undergoing revision and improvement
                            in order to meet the new requirements <sup>4</sup>. HTML5 is the newest version of
                            HTML which is supported by most internet browsers. Combined with tools like CSS3, HTML5
                            provides advantages to both personal and business interests. HTML5 allows users to view
                            content across multiple platforms, such as iOS and Android. Moreover, it is known
                            that search engines filter the webpages in such way that the users are provided with the
                            best results based on their search.With the growth of internet, no matter how complex a
                            website is and what advanced technologies are used to make it look fancy, HTML is at the core of the page <sup>2</sup>.
                            Without HTML we would not be able to access any readable content or, in short, we would not be able to access the internet.</p>

                    <b>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</b> is similar to HTML, as they present similar markup elements
                    and
                    structure. XML was designed to describe the data that is being published. It is a self-describing
                    markup language, meaning the tags used to describe the data are not predefined.
                    They can be whatever the user wants them to be, as long as they are defined within the source code
                    <sup>5</sup>. There are many features XML has that make it easier to use than HTML. To begin with,
                    it is difficult to use HTML when incorporating dynamic elements within the source code, because
                    every time the data changes, the source code needs to be edited and updated; however, data can be
                    stored in XML files and only use HTML for design. This is where scripting comes handy. JavaScript
                    can be used to read an XML file, which will enable the user to edit the data displayed on the
                    webpage every time it is necessary, without interfering with the HTML source code <sup>6</sup>.<br/><br/>

                    <b>XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)</b> is, as described by the World Wide Web
                    Consortium
                    (W3C), <i>a reformulation of HTML 4.0 as an application of the Extensible Markup Language (XML)</i>
                    <sup>7</sup>. Being a stricter version of HTML in terms of structure, XHTML enables the user to
                    view the content at the same quality across different browsers <sup>8</sup>.A switch from HTML to
                    XHTML is beneficial for the future, because, according to IBM, it will improve the speed at which
                    the webpages load, due to the simpler structure of the text in the XML format. Moreover, HTML uses
                    definite tags, so therefore the browsers needs to check both the opening and closing tags; however,
                    as XML uses self-described tags under the same format, it is easier to display the content across
                    different browsers <sup>9</sup>.

            <div class="content_body">
                <ul><b>LaTeX</b> is a document preparation system for the typesetting program TeX .LaTeX is
                    considered a standard among academics and publishers for its easily distributed high quality output
                    and for being lightweight but powerful, portable, and free. It is ideal for any kind of
                    document, with emphasis on scientific and mathematical ones, due to its support for technical
                    typesetting and its ease of use <sup>10</sup>. Oetiker et al.(2015)<sup>11</sup> pointed out the difficulty in
                    designing a new layout, while also pointing out (2015 p.3) that <i>they [users] almost never need to
                    tinker with the actual layout</i>. Gavin (2002) claimed that LaTeX can be difficult to learn, as
                    previously mentioned, due to the lack of resources directed at beginners, although this reasoning
                    seems to be outdated. Oetiker et al. (2015 p. 3) also refuted this claim, stating that <i>users only
                    need to learn a few easy-to-understand commands</i>.< /br>< /br>

                    <p>A document consists of two main parts, the preamble and the body. The first is where the user
                        defines the document, stating its kind and any characteristics such as font size. This procedure
                        is the same for all documents, although the exact commands used will vary according to the
                        user’s needs. The second part of the document is the body, which is the actual text, confined
                        between begin and end commands <sup>12</sup>. the user needs to compile the document, in order to
                        generate an output for publication and distribution. To make this process easier, a .pdf output
                        seems to be the best option. The process described will generate a basic LaTeX document in .pdf,
                        in a convenient and smooth process, using free software based on a Linux operating system. Of
                        all operating systems, LaTeX shares a stronger connection with Linux. Much like open source
                        software, LaTeX allows users to use packages when defining document.</p>

            <div class="content_body">
                <u1>The definition of <b>scripting</b> is not considered set in stone. However, one definition of a scripting
                    language is <i>a high-level programming language that is interpreted by another program at runtime
                    rather than compiled by the computer’s processor</i> <sup>13</sup>. It has many different uses, but
                    in essence it is a very powerful, time-saving tool with applications such as automating tedious
                    tasks normally carried by humans, or providing a dynamic element to a web page. There are negatives
                    to using scripting languages instead of lower level programming languages, such as the fact that
                    they are less efficient since each line of code is read one at a time instead of being compiled as a
                    whole. However, the fact that it takes a much shorter amount of time to learn and start creating
                    scripts than learning a whole new language will outweigh this issue in the eyes of most people.

                    <p>An example of a common scripting language used to add a dynamic element to a web page is <b>JavaScript</b>.
                    This allows the addition of user interactive features such as drop down menus and “popups”.
                    According to developer.mozilla.org (2015)<sup>14</sup>, JavaScript operates on the client-side of the internet,
                    in that it decides how web pages react in the browser on instance of some event. This differs from
                    server side scripting where “all of the code is executed on the server before the data is passed to
                    the user's browser” as reported by php.about.com <sup>15</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Another commonly used scripting language is <b>PHP</b>. This is an example of a server-side language
                        which is one area in which it differs from JavaScript, meaning the script is run on the web
                        server before reaching the client. It is able to run on most operating systems including Linux,
                        Windows and Mac OS X, allowing cross-platform communication. PHP has the ability to output not
                        only HTML but other types of data including images and “can autogenerate these files and save them in the file system,
                        instead of printing it out, forming a server-side cache for your dynamic content” <sup>16</sup>.</p>
