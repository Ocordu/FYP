			<ul>
				<li>The university in its current form was founded in 2004, when the Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology decided to merge into one, to create the largest single-site university in the UK.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/)</li>
				<li>25 Nobel prize winners have worked or studied at the university, the first being J.J.Thomson in 1906, for his contributions to physics. The most recent was in 2010, shared between Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov for the discovery and preparation of graphene.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/nobel-prize/)</li>
				<li>The university currently owns 245 buildings over 270 hectares of land, with further plans to spend £1 billion to upgrade and expand facilities over the next 10 years.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/facts-figures/) </li>
				<li>According to the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities, UoM was ranked #41 in the world, #8 in Europe and #5 in the UK.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/facts-figures/)</li>
				<li>Over 12,000 staff makes it one of the largest employers in Greater Manchester as of a headcount in July 2015.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/facts-figures/) </li>
				<li>83% of research conducted at the university in 2014 was considered 'world-leading' or 'internationally excellent' by the Research Excellence Framework.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/facts-figures/) </li>
				<li>The University has an annual outcome of £1.01bn, with roughly 40% coming directly from tuition fees.
					(http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/facts-figures/)</li>
				<li>Examples of research groups based at the University of Manchester include:
					<li>The imaging sciences research group, which is concerned with the understanding and synthesis of face images by both machines and humans and has close links with the School of Computer Science. (http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/groups/imaging-sciences/)</li>
					<li>The Software Engineering group, which investigates novel approaches to software development; for example component-based software development, using symmetry and symmetry-breaking in software design, and using patterns for analysis, design, implementation and evolution of software.

			<li>The school was founded in October 1964 by Tom Kilburn who was the first professor of Computer Science.
				(http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/)</li>
			<li>The very first intake of new students in 1965 contained 24 men and 4 women.
				(http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/)</li>
			<li>In 1964, the Manchester Atlas, containing some 60,000 transistors and able to perform 700,000 instructions per second, was the most powerful computer in the world. It was also the first to a "single level store", which is now commonly known as "virtual memory", a technique still prevalent in modern technology.
				(http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/)</li>
			<li>Hillary Kahn was the first female to work in the department, joining in 1967. She eventually retired almost 40 years later in 2006 after contributing hugely to the growth of Computer Science at the university and commissioning a piece of mosaic artwork which can be viewed in the Kilburn building.
				(http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/)</li>
			<li>5 staff members of the School of Computer Science have received honours from the Queen, the first being Tom Kilburn in 1973, the most recent being Carole Goble in 2014.
				(http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/) </li>
			<li>As of December 2014, approximately 250,000 citations have been made to research papers written by academic staff at the school.
				(http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/50-years/)</li>
			<li>The SpiNNaker chip was developed by Professor Steve Furber and the Advanced Processor Technologies Research Group at the university. It is a new piece of computer architecture inspired by the workings of the human brain and is set to be used by neuroscientists to study diseases such as Alzheimer's.
